This directory is used to implement user-defined functionality to the parser generator

Everything that is currently in this the bare-minimum to run the parser generator with
the Hammer parser toolkit, however, the user is able to add functionality freely

Below is a description of all the contents of this directory:

actions/
      This directory is for creating user-defined action functions.  When files with the
    .act extension are placed in this file, they will be line by line inserted into the
    parser which is generated.  This can be useful if the user wants to implement logic
    attached to a given combinator.

directives/
      This directory is for creating user-defined directives.  Any file in this directory,
    regardless of extension or name, will be inserted at the top of the parser's header
    file.  In this directory, 'includes.txt' is already included with the required 
    include directives to compile the parser.

functions/
      This directory is for creating user-defined functions.  When files with the .fun
    extension are placed in this file, they will be line by line inserted into the parser
    which is generated.  This is useful when the user wants to write functions which will
    be used in user-generated actions.

objects/
      This directory is for creating user-defined objects such as structs or enums. This
    is useful when the user wants to implement custom data types to use in their custom
    actions or functions

info/
      This directory contains a few files which add a comment section to some of the generated
    files.  These comment blocks can be rather large, so feel free to delete them from the
    generated directrory structure (not src/data/*) before running any generators

Makefile
      This file is a good base for the makefile necessary to run the parser and any generated
    test files.
